# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

## Info

This is a frontend project for my developer portfolio using React.

This project is the redesign of my previous portfolio [previous portfolio](https://github.com/MaxLeblc/portfolio)

For the style, I like to code my own mechanics rather than rely on animation libraries except framer-motion for a draggable element.
